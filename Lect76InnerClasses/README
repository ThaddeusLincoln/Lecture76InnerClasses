Inner classes in java can be of 4 types:

1. Static nested classes : is mainly used to associate a class with its outer class. So it'll be packaged
in its outer class instead of in the package. Meaning, that it can not access non static methods or members
or its outer class without first creating an instance of that class.

2. Non-static nested classes (Inner classes). This class can access all method and fields of its outer 
class, even those marked as private.
3. Local class: it's an inner class defined inside of scope block (usually a method)
4. Anonymous class : is a nested class without a class name
